* The relay pin needs to be put to HIGH in order to cut the current to the motors. This was done because when the ESP8266 is launched, there is a "spike" on pin 0 which would have triggered the motor initialization process (where it goes from side to side once). However, there is a way to fix it, by reprogramming the motor-control arduinos to wait (ie. adding a delay() in their setup()) so that they are not affected by the spike.
